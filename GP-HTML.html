		<h2>What is Stress?</h2>
		<p>Engineering Stress can be a difficult concept to grasp and explain, even to those who get to deal with it regularly. Many units of measure are easy to see, understand, and compare: a friendly bear is much taller than you, weighs much more, and can run much faster than you<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[*]</span><span class="refbody">Bear: 3. You: 0</span>. But the tree branch you and the bear are both hanging from is also undergoing stress<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[*]</span><span class="refbody">Slightly different than the stress you may be experiencing</span> which may not be readily visible…until it breaks!</p>

		<h3>Why It's Important</h3>
		<p>As engineers, we are tasked with designing and building objects that perform the use they are intended for and are safe for the person using them. So, when designing everyday objects like a bridge over troubled waters, a staircase to heaven, a wonderwall, or a hotel in California, it is imperative that we accurately calculate stresses and choose the right materials and geometries so that they don’t break unexpectedly!</p>
		
		<h3>So What Is It?</h3>
		<p>When a force acts on a material, causing it to deform and change shape, the molecules within that material are forcibly moved further apart or closer together. These molecules <i>do not like</i> to be forcibly separated or squished together, and the material will have an internal resistance to the applied load. This is called <b>Stress</b>.</p>
		
		<p>The amount that a material expands relative to its original size is called <b>Engineering Strain</b>. Strain is related to Stress by a material property, as will be discussed in the next section. But Engineering Stress can be calculated using only two inputs:</p>
		
		<div class="InnerBox" style="color:crimson">The amount and direction of forces applied</div>
		<div class="InnerBox" style="color:blue">The geometry of the material</div>
		
		<p>Whether or not the material will break under a certain amount of stress depends on the <b>type of material</b>, and more specifically, how well that material resists getting bent, pulled, compressed, or twisted.</p>
	</div>

		<h2>The Stress-Strain Diagram</h2>
		<h3>Young's Modulus of Elasticity</h3>
		<p>Stress and strain are directly proportional to each other by a factor called Young’s Modulus of Elasticity which is a property of the material itself. Young's Modulus is basically a measure of how stiff a material is. Materials with a larger Young's Modulus are capable of handling higher levels of stress before they deform irreparably. In the Stress-Strain Diagram show below, Young's Modulus is the slope of the straight part of the graph. The steeper the slope, the more stress a material can handle with lower strain (i.e. less "stretchy").</p>

		</div>
		
		<h3>Elastic Deformation</h3>
		<p>If only pulled apart slightly and then released, then the molecules will return to exactly the same place they started, in their normal unstressed state. This is called an <i>elastic deformation</i>. One way to think about this is to consider your favorite pair of pants. They fit perfectly, right? Have too many tacos one night<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[*]</span><span class="refbody">A quality excuse</span>, and they may stretch a little bit and be a little more snug, but they will return to their normal size afterwards. However, lend them to a larger friend and they may not come back in the same condition they were borrowed,  as they've been "over-stretched".<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[*]</span><span class="refbody">Probably just let your friend have them at that point</span>  This happens with other materials too.</p>
		
		<h3>Plastic Deformation and Fracture</h3>
		<p>Forcibly stretch a material too far apart and the material can be damaged, often by elongating. This is called <i>plastic deformation</i> and is represented by the rounded part of the graph above. The point at the end of the graph represents when a material's molecules are pulled so far apart that the material will fracture and break into separate pieces, the equivalent to loaning your favorite pair of pants to an elephant.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[*]</span><span class="refbody">(Not recommended)</span></p>

		<h1>Calculating Stress</h1>
	</div>
	
	<div id="Calculations" class="CalcSection">
		<h2>How to Calculate Stress</h2>
		<p>Though the term may be intangible, Stress is relatively straightforward to calculate using knowledge of the two qualities mentioned above: how much force is applied to a material and the object's geometry (it doesn't depend on the type of material!). The calculation is made even easier because <b>firstly</b>, there are only two types of stress (normal and shear) and <b>secondly</b>, Engineering Stress is additive in nature. All of the stress in a single location of the same kind can be added together, no matter the source of that stress (bending, twisting, bears, etc.).</p>
		
		<h3>Normal and Shear Stress</h3>
		<p>As mentioned above, the two main types of Engineering Stress  are <b>Normal Stress</b> (denoted by sigma, <b>&#963;</b>) and <b>Shear Stress</b> (denoted by tau, <b>&#964;</b>). To help us understand these, we're going to revisit our friendly bear. Unfortunately, he got into some very sticky honey and can no longer separate his two paws from each other. Here the honey represents the resistance to change that the molecules in a material also experience, aka "Stress". If he tries to pull his paws apart directly away from each other, the sticky honey will resist his attempts to escape. If he pushes his paws together, there will be honey in the way and the honey will squish. Both these two applied forces create Normal Stress in the honey, with "pulling" or tensile stress commonly considered positive (+) and "squishing" or compressive stress commonly considered negative (-). After these two unsuccessful attempts at honey freedom, our bear friend may try to slide his two paws apart, side to side in a rubbing motion. Again, the honey will resist, this time creating Shear Stress in the honey.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[*]</span><span class="refbody">Don't worry, he eventually licked his way to freedom.</span></p>

		<h3>(Some of) The Equations</h3>
		<p>To the right are several of the main types of stress and their general equations using the applied forces and geometries. Variables based on the <span style="color:red"><b>applied load</b></span> are colored red, while variables based on <span style="color:blue"><b>object geometries</b></span> are colored in blue.</p>
		
		<p>There are a few caveats and exceptions to the equations that should be mentioned however:</p>
		
		<p><b>Firstly</b>, it is important to note (except for the case of axial loading) how the stress changes depending on what point on the cross-sectional area you are investigating. While beam bending has the highest stresses at the top and bottom of the beam, with the minimal amount at the neutral axis (the centerline for vertically symmetrical faces), shear stress due to beam shear is just the opposite and has maximum stress at the neutral axis, and zero at the top and bottom of the beam!</p>
		
		<!--
		<h3 style="color:tomato">Include pic of varying stress across cross-sectional area for Torsion/bending/shear</h3>
		<img src="ContentPics\Equation-BeamShearExtra.png" class="PicLabel" style="border-color:tomato">
		-->
		
		<p><b>Secondly</b>, to successfully use these equations to solve basic three-dimensional beam problems like the tool on this page does, the user must picture how these equations are applicable in other directions. If a sideways force is being applied to the end of the beam, there will be beam bending in a side-to-side direction, as well as horizontal beam shear, and the cross-sectional heights and widths used to make calculations are switched!</p>
		
		<p><b>Thirdly</b>, it should be stressed that these equations do require a bit more grunt work as the cross-sections become more complicated, often referring to tables or performing integrals to calculate Area Moment of Inertia (I), or the Polar Moment of Inertia (J). Finding the Polar Moment of Inertia, even for a simple rectangular cross-section is a bit too complicated to go into here, and is purposefully omitted. To calculate shear stress due to beam shear, the equations to find the stress at any point are actually as shown below, but it is often easier and more useful to look at the maximum stress. Luckily, plugging in values for the neutral axis where the stress is greatest results in the simplified equations to the right.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[*]</span><span class="refbody">#yay</span></p>

		<img src="ContentPics\Equation-BeamShearExtra.png" class="PicLabel" title="TAUabunga Dude!">
		
		<p><b>Finally</b>, there are a couple other ways that stress can be induced in an object that can't be well-explained with the simple beam model used in the tool below, such as pressure vessels, fatigue, and stress due to thermal expansion.</p>

		<div class="PicLabel">
			<img src="ContentPics\StressEquationsVert.png" title="Stress(ful) Equations"/>
			Stress Equations
		</div>

		<p>Now that we know how to calculate different types of stress, we have to keep track of which stresses are Normal or Shear, which surfaces they apply to, and which direction they are in.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="Cube" class="CalcSection">
		<h2>Representative Stress Cube</h2>
		<p>To help with the difficulties of keeping track of normal and shear stresses, and which stresses can and cannot be added together, a representative cube with infinitesimally small sides is used as a visual aid <b>at the location of interest</b> (remember that the top of a beam's cross-section  may have very different stresses than the center or neutral-axis!). Each face of the cube has normal stresses (stresses perpendicular to each face) which represent the material being compressed or pulled apart, and shear stresses (stresses along the surface) which can be imagined as the material sliding against itself with friction between the two surfaces (bear paws sliding across each other), or from a side view, someone pulling two opposite corners of a square piece of fabric apart so that it takes on a more diamond-like shape.</p>
		
		<div class="PicLabel">
			<img src="CubePics\CubeEverything.png">
			Representative Cube Stresses
		</div>
	</div>
	
	<div id="Equilibrium" class="CalcSection">
		<h2>Stress Cube Equilibrium</h2>
		<p>As Newton’s Third law has taught us, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Assuming the material in question is not in motion, for each stress applied to this cube in one direction, there is an equal stress in the opposite direction. For Normal stresses, this means the top and bottom face stresses are pulling up and down respectively with the same quantity. Likewise, the front and back, and left and right stresses pull in equal but opposite directions from each other.</p>
		
		<div class="PicLabel">
			<img src="ContentPics\CubeEquilibriumNormal.png" alt="Cube Equilibrium - Normal Stresses" title="You're tearing me apart Lisa!" id="CubePic">
			Cube Equalized with Normal Stresses
		</div>
		
		<p>The Shear stresses are the same, just harder to visualize. If there's stress sliding across one surface, then there must also be a stress on the opposite side of the cube in the opposite direction. If you just have these two opposing stresses, then the cube would spin - it would not be in equilibrium. Therefore another pair of stresses appear on the two connecting faces, to balance this out.</p>
		
		<div class="PicLabel">
			<img src="ContentPics\CubeEquilibriumShear.png" alt="Cube Equilibrium - Shear Stresses" title="And don't call me Shearly" id="CubePic">
			Cube Equalized with Shear Stresses
		</div>
		
		<p>Since the backside of the cube is both hard to see, and easy to infer what the reaction stresses look like based on the front three sides of the cube, the stresses are often left off for visual's sake, and assumed present to maintain equilibrium.</p>

		<h1>Stress Visualization</h1>
	</div>
	
	<!-- 
		Wording and pictures here need a lot of work

	<div id="VisExp1" class="VisSection">
		<h2>Picture This</h2>
		<p>One way to visualize stress is through color. You may have heard of "Finite Element Analysis" before and seen pictures like the one below that highlight a stressed area versus non-stressed area. Obviously these colors do not appear in real life as stresses are induced. However, these are great tools to see where an applied load and certain geometries can cause high stresses in the structures, allowing the designer to change the geometry to lower the stress that is experienced in those problem areas before it gets built. However, those tools are expensive to use, require a lot of fine adjustments to get an accurate model, and can take a lot of time to compile. Being able to do quick, back-of-the-napkin<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[*]</span><span class="refbody">Clean napkins preferred - we said "Strain" not "Stain"</span> calculations and having a good idea where high stress points may occur can save a lot of time and energy!</p>

	</div>
	
	<div id="VisExp2" class="VisSection">
		<h2>Principal Stress</h2>
		<p>In pictures like the wing on the left, the different types of stress are not usually differentiated between normal stress and shear stress. One reason for this is that by changing our frame of reference using a nifty mathematical tool called "Mohr's Circle"<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[*]</span><span class="refbody">Originally called "S'Mores Circle", but engineers kept getting too hungry for sweets during their all-nighters, so the "S" was removed.</span>, we can find what are called <b>principal stresses</b>, which are more useful to plot, and tell us a lot more about whether a material can withstand the stress being created in it.</p>
		
		<p>To understand principal stresses we are going to visit our bear friend one last time. This time he is feeling very talkative and decides to say hello through a very loud roar. You and your friend are both standing 50' away from the bear, but neither of you are right in front of him, so it's not as loud. But if you could measure how loud he sounded from where you were standing and how far away from him / in what direction you were, you could calculate out how loud he was if you were standing right in front of him. To hear his hello properly and at its loudest, that's where you'd want to be. But his emitted roar doesn't actually change in volume, you just happened to be standing in the wrong (or right) spot to not get slobbered on.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[*]</span><span class="refbody">Or eaten.</span></p>		
		
		<div class="PicLabel">
			<img src="ContentPics\MohrsCircleBear.png" alt="Bear Hello and Principal Stresses" id="MohrsBear" title="The Roaring Twenties"/>
			Bear Hello's and Principal Stresses
		</div>
		
		<p>So it is with stress! The amount of stress we calculated using the formulas above is similar to what we happen to hear when we're standing off to the side of the bear. But to truly hear his "Good Morning!", i.e. find the principal stresses, we'd have to change our reference point. By figuratively rotating our representative cube, the normal and shear stresses will vary. At a certain point by rotating to juuuust the right angle, the Normal Stresses will be highest (principal), and the Shear Stresses will be lowest. At an exactly orthogonal (right angle) to this, the Shear Stresses will be highest, and the Normal Stresses will be lowest. Depending on which one's greater, it is at one of these two angles that the material would most likely break!<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[*]</span><span class="refbody">COOL RIGHT&#8253;</span></p>
		<p>Using Mohr's Circle as described above and comparing that value to the material's yield stress or Ultimate tensile strength will inform whether or not a material will be irreparably deformed or break. Unfortunately our bear friend is tired of teaching us engineering concepts and has gone back to his bear family<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[*]</span><span class="refbody">Maybe he'll be right back, and just needed a quick paws.</span>, and the details of using Mohr's Circle will have to be covered another time by another bear.</p>

	<div id="Cantilever" class="ToolSection">
		<h2>Cantilever Beams</h2>
		<p>A cantilever beam is a long thin piece (usually the height and width is less than 10% of the length) that is fully supported at one side, i.e. the wall provides reaction moments and forces in all directions. Cantilevered beams are often used in engineering problems as they can be easily added together and analyzed to represent all sorts of complex structures from bridges to airplane wings.</p>

	<div id="UsingThisTool" class="ToolSection">
		<h2>Using this Tool</h2>
		<p>Start by changing various forces and moments to see how the beam reacts! A side with green on it represents "Tension" and a side with red represents "Compression." See which forces and moments update the stresses in the "Stress Results" box. Why do some forces and moments not show up on the representative cube (located at the yellow dot on the beam)? Do some forces cause a bigger stress than others? Why is that? What if the location of the yellow dot was on the side of the beam instead of on top?</p>
