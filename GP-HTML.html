		<h2>What is Stress?</h2>
		<p>Engineering Stress can be a difficult concept to grasp and explain, even to those who are lucky enough to deal with it regularly. Many units of measure are easy to see, understand, and compare: a friendly bear is much taller than you, weighs much more, and can run much faster than you<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[*]</span><span class="refbody">Bear: 3. You: 0</span>. But the tree branch you and the bear are both hanging from is also undergoing stress<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[*]</span><span class="refbody">Slightly different than the stress you may be experiencing</span> which may not be readily visible…until it breaks!</p>

		<h3>Why It's Important</h3>
		<p>As engineers, we are tasked with designing and building objects that perform the use they are intended for, and ideally are safe for the person using them. So, when designing everyday objects like a bridge over troubled waters, a staircase to heaven, a wonderwall, or a hotel in California, it is imperative that we accurately calculate stresses and choose the right materials and geometries so that they don’t break unexpectedly!</p>
		
		<h3>So What Is It?</h3>
		<p>When a force acts on a material, causing it to deform and change shape, the molecules within that material are forcibly moved further apart or closer together. These molecules do <i>not</i> like to be forcibly separated or squished together, and the material will have an internal resistance to the applied load. This is called <b>Stress</b>.</p>
		<p>The amount that a material expands relative to its original size is called <b>Engineering Strain</b>.</p>
		<div class="InnerBox">Engineering Stress is calculated using only two inputs:<br><br>
		<ul style="font-weight:bold">
			<li>The amount and direction of forces applied</li>
			<li>The geometry of the material</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		Whether or not the material will break under a certain amount of stress depends on the <b>type of material</b>, and more specifically, how well that material resists getting bent, pulled, compressed, or twisted.</div>

		<h2>The Stress-Strain Diagram</h2>
		<h3>Young's Modulus of Elasticity</h3>
		<p>Stress and strain are directly proportional to each other by a factor called Young’s Modulus of Elasticity which is a property of the material itself. Young's Modulus is basically a measure of how stiff a material is. Materials with a larger Young's Modulus are capable of handling higher levels of stress before they deform irreparably. In the Stress-Strain Diagram show below, Young's Modulus is the slope of the straight part of the graph. The steeper the slope, the more stress a material can handle with lower strain (i.e. less "stretchy").</p>

		<div class="PicLabel">Stress-Strain Diagram</div>
		<br>
		<h3>Elastic Deformation</h3>
		<p>If only pulled apart slightly and then released, then the molecules will return to exactly the same place they started, in their normal unstressed state. This is called an <i>elastic deformation</i>. One way to think about this is to consider your favorite pair of pants. They fit perfectly, right? Have too many tacos one night<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[*]</span><span class="refbody">A quality excuse</span>, and they may stretch a little bit and be a little more snug, but they will return to their normal size afterwards. However, lend them to a larger friend and they may not come back in the same condition they were borrowed,  as they've been "over-stretched".<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[*]</span><span class="refbody">Probably just let your friend have them at that point</span>  This happens with other materials too.</p>
		
		<h3>Plastic Deformation and Fracture</h3>
		<p>Forcibly stretch a material too far apart and the material can be damaged, often by elongating. This is called <i>plastic deformation</i> and is represented by the rounded part of the graph above. The point at the end of the graph represents when a material's molecules are pulled so far apart that the material will fracture and break into separate pieces, the equivalent to loaning your favorite pair of pants to an elephant.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[*]</span><span class="refbody">(Not recommended)</span></p>

		<h2>How to Calculate Stress</h2>
		<p>Though the term may be intangible, Stress is relatively straightforward to calculate using knowledge of the two qualities mentioned above: how much force is applied to a material and the object's geometry (it doesn't depend on the type of material!). The calculation is made even easier because firstly, there are only two types of stress (normal and shear) and secondly, Engineering Stress is additive in nature. All of the stress in a single location of the same kind can be added together, no matter the source of that stress (bending, twisting, bears, etc.).</p>
		
		<p>The two main types of Engineering Stress already hinted at above are <b>Normal Stress</b> and <b>Shear Stress</b>. To help us understand these, we're going to revisit our friendly bear. Unfortunately, he got into some very sticky honey and can no longer separate his two paws from each other. Here the honey represents the resistance to change that the molecules in a material also experience, aka "Stress". If he tries to pull his paws apart directly away from each other, the sticky honey will resist his attempts to escape. If he pushes his paws together, there will be honey in the way and the honey will squish. Both these two applied forces create Normal Stress in the honey, with "pulling" or tensile stress commonly considered positive and "squishing" or compressive stress commonly considered negative. After these two unsuccessful attempts at honey freedom, our bear friend may try to slide his two paws apart, side to side in a rubbing motion. Again, the honey will resist, this time creating Shear Stress in the honey.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[*]</span><span class="refbody">Don't worry, he eventually licked his way to freedom.</span></p>

		<p><br>Now that we know how to calculate different types of stress, we have to keep track of which stresses are Normal or Shear, which surfaces they apply to, and which direction they are in.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="Cube" class="CalcSection">
		<p>To help with these three issues, a representative cube is used as a visual aid. Each face of the cube has normal stresses (stresses perpendicular to each face) which represent the material being compressed or pulled apart, and shear stresses (stresses along the surface) which can be imagined as the material sliding against itself with friction between the two surfaces, or from a side view, someone pulling two opposite corners of a square piece of fabric apart so that it takes on a more diamond-like shape.</p>
		<img src="CubePics\CubeEverything.png">
		<div class="PicLabel">Representative Cube Stresses</div>
		<p><br>As Newton’s Third law has taught us, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Assuming the material in question is not in motion, for each stress applied to this cube in one direction, there is an equal stress in the opposite direction. For Normal stresses, this means the top and bottom face stresses are pulling up and down respectively with the same quantity. Likewise, the front and back and left and right stresses pull in equal but opposite directions from each other. The Shear stresses are the same, just harder to visualize. If there's stress sliding across one surface, then there must also be a stress on the opposite side of the cube in the opposite direction. If you just have these two opposing stresses, then the cube would spin - it would not be in equilibrium. Therefore another pair of stresses appear in on the two connecting faces, to balance this out.</p>

		<h2>Picture This</h2>
		<p>One way to visualize stress is through color. You may have seen Finite Element Analyses pictures like the one below that highlight a stressed area versus non-stressed area. In pictures like these the different types of stress are not usually differentiated, red just means more stress, and yellow or blue represent less.   these, Compressive Stress, where a material’s molecules are pushed together, is often colored differently than Tensile Stress, where a material’s molecules are pulled apart.
